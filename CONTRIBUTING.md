# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the Business Ideas project! We welcome contributions from everyone.

## Coding standards

- Follow language-specific best practices (e.g., PEP8 for Python, ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript).
- Write clear and concise code with comments where necessary.
- Include unit tests for new functionality and ensure existing tests continue to pass.

## Branch naming conventions

Create branches off of `main` using the following prefixes:

- `feature/<short-description>` for new features and enhancements.
- `bugfix/<short-description>` for bug fixes.
- `task/<short-description>` for small tasks and chores.
- `research/<short-description>` for exploratory work.

Use hyphens to separate words (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`).

## Review and merge process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main` before opening a pull request (PR).
2. Open a PR against `main` describing the change, linking relevant issues or tasks.
3. Assign appropriate labels (Type, Priority, Team, Status) and request a reviewer.
4. All PRs must pass CI checks and be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
5. Once approved and all checks pass, the reviewer or maintainer merges the PR using the merge button. Squash merges are preferred.
6. Do not commit directly to the `main` branch.

## Code of conduct

Please be respectful and considerate in all interactions. We strive to create an inclusive and supportive environment for all contributors.
