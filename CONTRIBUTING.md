# Contributing to Knowledge Harvest

Thank you for your interest in contributing!  By sharing your expertise, you help us preserve and disseminate tacit knowledge throughout the organisation.

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue** – Before starting work, open a new issue using the appropriate template (feature, bug or task).  Describe the problem or idea clearly and add acceptance criteria.
2. **Create a branch** – Use a descriptive branch name based on the issue number (e.g. `feat/23-add-video-trimmer`).
3. **Make changes** – Follow coding standards and add tests where appropriate.  When documenting tacit knowledge flows, remember that tacit knowledge is often informal, subjective and non‑codified【261120688409170†screenshot】.  Use screen captures, transcripts and narratives to illustrate the expert’s process.
4. **Write good commit messages** – Explain *why* changes are made, not just *what* changed.
5. **Submit a pull request** – Use the pull‑request template to summarise your changes, link the relevant issue and describe any impacts on existing functionality.
6. **Respond to reviews** – Collaborate with reviewers to refine your contribution.  After approval, the change will be merged to the main branch.

## Code of conduct

Please be respectful and supportive when interacting with other contributors.  A knowledge‑friendly culture depends on open communication and recognition of the experiences that others share【94584336290138†screenshot】.
