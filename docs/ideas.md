# Business Ideas for Knowledge Harvest

This document collects innovative ideas for capturing and sharing tacit knowledge within organisations.  Tacit knowledge is the deep‑rooted, intuitive expertise that separates merely good organisations from truly great ones【224308209286044†screenshot】.  It includes instincts and hard‑won insights that cannot be easily articulated or transferred【947879009909907†screenshot】.

| Idea | Description |
|----|----|
| **Screen workflow capture** | Build a lightweight recorder that lets SMEs capture their screen while completing tasks.  The recorder should allow adding voice annotations to explain why steps are taken, since tacit knowledge often lives in the expert’s instincts【947879009909907†screenshot】.  After a recording, the system sends the video to the transcription and summarisation microservices. |
| **Mentor‑led sessions** | Pair new employees with seasoned mentors; record joint sessions where the mentor explains implicit decision‑making.  Mentorship and apprenticeship programmes transfer tacit knowledge through close collaboration【94584336290138†screenshot】. |
| **Storytelling & case‑study library** | Organise regular storytelling sessions where employees share experiences and insights【473640312520138†screenshot】.  Store these narratives and case studies in a searchable library.  Storytelling makes complex tacit knowledge memorable. |
| **Knowledge‑friendly culture toolkit** | Provide tools for managers to promote open communication and recognise knowledge sharing【94584336290138†screenshot】.  This includes recognition badges and prompts to document after‑action reviews. |
| **After‑action review module** | Integrate a template that guides teams through structured after‑action reviews.  AARs capture lessons learned and share tacit knowledge from projects【29014544567894†screenshot】. |

These ideas can be prioritised and turned into GitHub issues for development.
