# Knowledge Harvest - Project Status Report

## Executive Summary

The Knowledge Harvest project aims to create a platform for capturing and sharing tacit subject-matter-expert knowledge through screen recordings. The project is currently in the early development phase with a basic foundation in place. This report outlines the current status, identifies gaps, and recommends next steps to complete the MVP as defined in the project requirements.

## Current Status

### What's Implemented

1. **Project Structure**
   - Repository setup with basic organization
   - Docker development environment with PostgreSQL, LocalStack S3, and Node.js services
   - Initial frontend and backend codebases

2. **Frontend**
   - Basic React application structure
   - Screen recording functionality using WebRTC
   - Recording controls (start/stop/pause)
   - Recording time tracking with 15-minute limit
   - Metadata form for title, description, and tags
   - Basic browsing interface with search and filtering

3. **Backend**
   - Express API with basic endpoints
   - PostgreSQL database schema
   - File upload handling with multer
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Basic error handling

### What's Missing

1. **Core MVP Features**
   - S3 integration for video storage (currently commented out)
   - Video playback functionality
   - Video streaming endpoint
   - Proper error handling and validation

2. **Code Organization**
   - Frontend code needs to be split into components
   - Backend needs better error handling and validation
   - Missing unit tests for both frontend and backend

3. **DevOps**
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Production deployment configuration
   - Monitoring and logging
   - Backup strategy

## Gap Analysis

### Technical Gaps

1. **S3 Integration**
   - The S3 configuration is commented out in the server.js file
   - No implementation for uploading videos to S3
   - No implementation for generating signed URLs for video retrieval

2. **Video Playback**
   - Missing video player component
   - No streaming endpoint for efficient video delivery
   - No support for range requests for video streaming

3. **Component Structure**
   - Frontend code is all in App.js, needs to be split into components
   - No custom hooks for reusable logic
   - No proper state management

### Process Gaps

1. **Testing**
   - No unit tests for backend API
   - No unit tests for frontend components
   - No end-to-end tests for critical user flows

2. **Documentation**
   - Limited API documentation
   - No user guide or onboarding materials
   - No deployment documentation

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps (1-2 Weeks)

1. **Complete Core MVP Features**
   - Implement S3 integration for video storage
   - Create video streaming endpoint
   - Develop video player component
   - Improve error handling and validation

2. **Code Organization**
   - Refactor frontend code into components
   - Create custom hooks for reusable logic
   - Improve backend error handling

### Short-Term Actions (2-4 Weeks)

1. **Testing**
   - Set up unit tests for backend API
   - Create unit tests for frontend components
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical flows

2. **DevOps**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Create production deployment configuration
   - Implement monitoring and logging

### Long-Term Considerations (Post-MVP)

1. **AI Features**
   - Implement transcription service
   - Add summarization capabilities
   - Develop knowledge indexing

2. **User Authentication**
   - Add user authentication and authorization
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Create user profiles

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **Browser Compatibility**
   - WebRTC support varies across browsers
   - Mitigation: Focus on modern browsers initially, add fallbacks later

2. **File Size Limits**
   - Large video files may cause storage and bandwidth issues
   - Mitigation: 15-minute cap reduces storage costs, implement efficient streaming

3. **Performance**
   - Video processing may be resource-intensive
   - Mitigation: Optimize video encoding, implement efficient streaming

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**
   - Temptation to add features beyond MVP
   - Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP definition, clear prioritization

2. **Resource Constraints**
   - Limited development resources
   - Mitigation: Focus on core features first, leverage existing libraries

## Conclusion

The Knowledge Harvest project has a solid foundation but requires focused effort to complete the MVP features. By prioritizing the S3 integration, video playback, and code organization, the team can deliver a functional product within the 5-week timeline outlined in the MVP definition.

The technical implementation guide, task assignments, and project roadmap provide a clear path forward for the development team. Regular status updates and adherence to the defined scope will be critical for successful delivery.

## Next Actions

1. Assign tasks to team members based on the task assignments document
2. Set up weekly sprint planning and review meetings
3. Implement the S3 integration as the highest priority task
4. Begin refactoring the frontend code into components
5. Create a testing strategy and start implementing unit tests
