  "description": "The **Knowledge Harvest** project aims to capture tacit subject‑matter‑expert (SME) knowledge and convert it into structured, reusable assets for training and onboarding.  Tacit knowledge is the deep‑rooted, intuitive understanding and expertise that resides within individuals and cannot be easily articulated or transferred【224308209286044†screenshot】.  It often includes hard‑won lessons, insights and instincts that people develop through experience【947879009909907†screenshot】.  These nuanced skills are fragile and can be lost when employees leave the organisation【776182156384248†screenshot】.  Knowledge Harvest provides tools for capturing screen workflows, voice rationales and after‑action reflections so that organisations can preserve this intangible know‑how and make it accessible to others.",
